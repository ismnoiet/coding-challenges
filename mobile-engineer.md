Write a 2 screens Android app that fetches the user's location and shows him/her nearby places:

The first screen will display a list of places around the user based on his current location
The second screen should show the place's details (name, image, website, and any other available data).

* You are free to use any 3rd party API to fetch the nearby places (not a native SDK)
* You are free to use any third party library in the app.
* Implement interactive actions on the place details (e.g. if phone number is available open the phone app when the user clicks it).
* UI tests are not manadatory but unit tests are
* Animations are not mandatory but are most welcome :)
