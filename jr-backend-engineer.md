We'd like you to implement a subset of the [JSONTest API](http://www.jsontest.com/):

* IP Address
* Headers
* Date & Time
* Echo JSON
* MD5

The application should be written in NodeJS, run in a docker container and we'd like you yo use [koa.js](http://koajs.com/) as HTTP framework. Other libraries are up to you!

If you are not familiar with one particular technology or have any question feel free to ask questions -- we'd like to clarify any doubt rather than have you waste time :)

Experienced developers would probably take an hour or so to build the whole thing, and we expect you to be able to finalize it in around 4/8 hours.
There's no deadline for the challenge, this is just to give you a rough idea of how long you'll probably have to spend on this (we'd like to keep it as short as possible as we understand candidates might be busy with other stuff).
