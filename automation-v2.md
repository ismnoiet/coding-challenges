# Automation v2

We love terraform, ansible, kubernetes with lots of automation :)

The objective is to:

* Use `terraform` to create an instance on `aws`
* Use `ansible` to provision a single-node `kubernetes` cluster with the instance created above
* Download `kubectl` binary locally to access the newly created cluster above

## Nice to have (but not important if not possible / running out of time)

* Use ansible provisioner or run ansible-playbook with terraform
